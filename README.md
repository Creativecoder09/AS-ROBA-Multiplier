The above code is the Verilog code for IEEE research paper named, "RoBA Multiplier: A Rounding-Based Approximate Multiplier for High-Speed yet Energy-Efficient".
The approach is to round the operands to the nearest exponent of two.
This way the computational intensive part of the multiplication is omitted improving speed and energy consumption at the price of a small error.
It proposed three hardware implementations of the approximate multiplier that includes one for the unsigned and two for the signed operations.
The efficiency of the proposed multiplier is evaluated by comparing its perforamance with those of some approximate and accurate multipliers using different design parameters. 
In addition, the efficacy of the proposed approximate multiplier is studied in two image processing applications, i.e., image sharpening and smoothing.
